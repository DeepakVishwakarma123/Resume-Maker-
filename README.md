# Resume Maker Project


Hey, I'm building a **Resume Maker** web app! This is a work in progress, and I’m going to try my best to add as many features as possible.

## Current Goals:
- Create a way for users to build and customize their own resumes.
- Add drag-and-drop functionality for sections.
- Let users preview and download their resumes in different formats.
- Try out some cool features like a random quote system and customizable templates.

## Future Ideas:
- Add dark mode and other themes.
- Let users export to job boards or share their resumes online.
- More customization options and designs.

## Status:
This is an ongoing project. I’m experimenting and improving as I go. Feedback and ideas are welcome!

## How to Run:
Just clone the repo, open `index.html` in your browser, and you can see the progress so far.

```bash
git clone # Resume Maker Project
